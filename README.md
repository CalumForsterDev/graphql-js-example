# GraphQL example application using GitHub's API

## How to run
  0. Download and install Node.js
    * [Using a packet manager (apt, yum, brew, ...)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
    * [Windows & Mac/Linux without package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  1. Using the terminal, clone this repo and cd into the directory
  2. ```$ npm install```
  3. ```$ npm start```
  4. The app should be running at http://localhost:4000/graphql

_Note: due to the GitHub API rate limit you can only make 60 requests per hour_

### Example query
To test the app is working correctly try the following query:
```js
query{
  profile(username:"Bob"){
    name
    username
    following{
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## How it works
The application is built using [GraphQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) and [express-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql). The documentation for GraphQL is really good and you should read the following pages if you get stuck:
  * [Getting Started](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/)
  * [Running an Express GraphQL Server](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/)
  * [Object Types](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/object-types/)
  * [Basic Types](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/basic-types/)

Each page should take around 10-15 minutes to read through.

This app also does a lot with Promises. If you are unfamiliar with these then spending some time reading the documentation would be very beneficial. Promises are used to keep track of asynchronous functions.

The NPM module [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) is used to make the HTTP GET requests to the GitHub API.


## Want to learn more?
Here are some tasks you can try which will help your understanding of GraphQL.

  1. Add a User field for `created_at` which will show the date as a string of when the profile was created. _[EASY]_
  2. Add a User field for `followers` and also add a instance method in the User class to resolve this field. This should resolve to a field similar to the `following` field. _[HARD]_
  3. Add a new Object Type for repositories and add a field for `repos` to the User object. See the GitHub API for repos [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/). You will need to do this with `https` which may not work behind a proxy. _Hint: try ```curl https://api.github.com/users/facebook/repos```_ _[VERY HARD]_
